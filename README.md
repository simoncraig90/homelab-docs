# Homelab Documentation

This repository documents the design, operation, and evolution of my
personal homelab environment. It is maintained as a public reference
for learning, experimentation, and professional development.

## Goals
- Build a reliable, recoverable virtualised environment
- Practice infrastructure, automation, and observability skills
- Separate production services from experimental workloads
- Document incidents and lessons learned

## Non-Goals
- High availability or enterprise-scale redundancy
- Zero-downtime guarantees
- Commercial hosting or multi-tenant usage

## Environment Overview
- Hypervisor: Proxmox
- Host: Minisforum mini-PC
- Workloads: media, automation, monitoring, AI experimentation

## Repository Structure
- ARCHITECTURE: system design and decisions
- RUNBOOKS: operational procedures and recovery steps
- INCIDENTS: incident timelines and factual records
- POSTMORTEMS: root cause analysis and improvements
- AUTOMATION: scripts and infrastructure automation
- REFERENCE: notes and technical references
- TEMPLATES: reusable documentation templates

## Status
This is a living system and documentation evolves alongside the lab.
